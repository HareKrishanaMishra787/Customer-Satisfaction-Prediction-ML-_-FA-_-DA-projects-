## 🌟 Project Overview
The **Customer Satisfaction Prediction** project analyzes **customer support ticket data** to uncover insights, track service trends, and predict satisfaction levels.  

It consists of two parts:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover customer behavior, ticket trends, and service bottlenecks.  
2. **Machine Learning (Prediction):** Build predictive models to forecast customer satisfaction and provide actionable insights.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify the **most frequent support issues**.  
- Track **ticket trends** over time and across demographics.  
- Analyze **customer behavior & demographics**.  
- Segment customers by **ticket type, priority, and satisfaction**.  
- Predict **customer satisfaction levels** using ML.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Size:** 8,469 records, 17 features  
- **Features include:**  
  - Customer Age, Gender  
  - Product Purchased, Date of Purchase  
  - Ticket Type, Status, Priority, Channel  
  - First Response Time, Resolution Time  
  - Customer Satisfaction Rating (1–5)  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code, SQL, Excel  

---

## 🔑 Key Steps
### 📍 Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Visualization of demographics, ticket trends, & satisfaction levels  
- Customer segmentation (ticket type, priority, channel)  
- Correlation analysis & trend analysis  

### 🤖 Part 2: Machine Learning
- Feature engineering & encoding  
- Model training (**Random Forest, Regression, Clustering**)  
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)  
- Feature importance ranking  
- Predictive insights for **business improvements**  

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- 📈 Ticket Volume Trends (Monthly & by Type/Priority)  
- 👥 Customer Age & Gender Distribution  
- ⭐ Average Satisfaction by Channel, Age & Gender  
- 🔥 Heatmap: Ticket Type vs Ticket Priority  
- ⏱️ Resolution Time vs Satisfaction Scatter Plot  
- 🎯 Top 10 Feature Importances for Satisfaction  

---

## 🚀 Use Cases
- **Customer Service Teams:** Monitor & improve service performance.  
- **Business Analysts:** Identify satisfaction drivers.  
- **Operations Managers:** Forecast workloads & resolution times.  
- **Product Teams:** Understand product feedback & improve UX.  

---

## 📈 Results
- Discovered **most common issues**: Refund requests, Software bugs, Delivery problems.  
- Highlighted **key drivers of satisfaction**: Ticket Priority, Channel, Resolution Time.  
- Built a **Random Forest Model** (baseline accuracy ~21%).  
- Generated **actionable insights** for process improvement.
